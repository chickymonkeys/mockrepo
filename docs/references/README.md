In this folder there are two files:

- `CreditPopulismRefs.bib` is a BibTeX file that is synchronised with Pizzi's Zotero so, if I add new papers in my collection for the paper, the file keeps updating runtime.
- `ExternalRefs.bib` is a BibTeX file for Nicol√≤ if you need to add other references without modifying the other file, which makes easier for you to add directly references on the draft.

At some point, we should sync the same file, but for now it can work like this.
