# Credit Shock and Populism

This is the `README` file for the repo of the research project 
_Credit Shock and Populism_ by Alessandro Pizzigolotto (NHH) and 
Nicol√≤ Fraccaroli (Brown). We started a new repo from the original work in 
the `CBKPolTrust` repo to give a look again to the entire code we have 
produced so far from the scratch, and move the workflow pipeline into R,
filling up Stata and Python code.

This is a work in progress and I will update the file in the ongoing.

- `FIXME` exposure calculation from the scratch
- `FIXME` git hooks with script to sync data in the cloud
